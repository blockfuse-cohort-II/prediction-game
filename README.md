# Lucky Me

## Overview
Lucky Me is a blockchain-based prediction game where players stake CORE tokens, submit answers to randomly generated questions, and earn points for correct predictions. The game is designed to be **fun, competitive, and rewarding**, featuring an AI-powered question-answering system and secure blockchain-based randomness to ensure fairness. Players compete for rankings on a **leaderboard** based on their accumulated points.

## How It Works
1. **Wallet Connection**: Players connect their wallets using **RainbowKit**.
2. **Staking**: Players stake **0.02 CORE** to participate in a game session.
3. **Prediction Phase**: The game presents **10 randomly generated questions**.
4. **AI-Generated Answers**: An **AI agent** generates answers for each question in the background.
5. **On-Chain Randomness**: The smart contract uses **secure randomness** to determine the correct answer (either **A or B**).
6. **Scoring System**:
   - **Correct Answer**: Players earn **100,000 points**.
   - **Wrong Answer**: **20,000 points are deducted**.
   - **Streak Bonus**: Players who get **3 consecutive correct answers** receive an extra **50,000 points**.
7. **Leaderboard Ranking**: Players are ranked based on their total points.
8. **Rewards**: Players who correctly predict at least **8 out of 10 answers** **double their staked CORE**.

## AI-Powered Answer Generation & Blockchain Randomness
- The **AI agent** generates random questions and potential answers, ensuring a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.
- The **final correct answer** for each question is determined **on-chain** using **randomness mechanisms** to ensure **fairness and prevent manipulation**.
- Since blockchain randomness is crucial, the smart contract leverages **Core DAO's native random number generation (RNG) solutions** to finalize outcomes in a **provably fair** manner.
